        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) can ready-to-bake crescent roll dough</li>
            <li>48 cocktail franks or other mini smoked sausages (about 1 pound)</li>
            <li>48 thin slices pepperoni (about 4 ounces)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a sheet pan with parchment.</li>
            <li>Separate crescent roll dough into 8 triangles, and place on the prepared sheet pan. Pop the pan into the freezer to firm up dough, about 10 minutes; it will be easier to cut and work with.</li>
            <li>Start with the longest and straightest side of a dough triangle, and cut 3 strips about 1-inch wide using a pizza cutter or sharp knife; then cut each strip into approximately 2-inch lengths. To make 48 pigs in a blanket youâ€™ll need to get 6 wrappable pieces from each triangle of dough. Press small end pieces and trimmings together as needed to create more 2-inch strips. If dough gets too warm and soft during the process, stop and return it to the freezer for a few minutes to firm up.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Wrap a cocktail frank with a piece of pepperoni, and place on one end of a dough strip. Roll up, finishing with the seam on the bottom. Repeat with remining ingredients.</li>
            <li>Arrange pigs in a blanket on a parchment or silpat-lined baking sheet in a 6x8 pattern, leaving a small amount of space between them, for 48 total. Brush tops with melted butter, and sprinkle with sesame seeds.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until beautifully golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve warm or room temperature with mustard or a mustard sauce. To make a quick mustard sauce, stir together equal parts mayonnaise and mustard.</li>
